Dependencies:
This makes use of two main programs:
libusb (rust equivalen is rusb), which provides the way to interface with the device.
GTK, provides the gui binding
###

###
To compile:
On linux:
To compile with cargo is easy, simply navigate to the overall directory and run: "cargo build --release". This will build and compile.
It requires only libusb and gtk. 
For libusb, on Debian "sudo apt-get install libusb-dev". On Arch "sudo pacman -S libusb"
For GTK, on Debian, "sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev build-essential". On Arch "sudo pacman -S gtk4 base-devel"


On windows:
More complicated. There are multiple ways. See the following URL https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/installation_windows.html for a description and process for GTK. 
I used the MSYS2 way and was able to get it to work. You'll need MSYS2 for libusb for it, so it seemed appropriate.
For libusb, install MSYS2, then "pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libusb". You may need to add MSYS2 to your path. The URL above gives a good way to do this.
After everything, you should be able to run "cargo build --release" to be finished.
